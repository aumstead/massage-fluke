        <h3 className={styles.h3}>Thai Foot Massage</h3>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          Thai foot massage is an ancient style of massage dating back to more
          than 2,500 years ago and typically has two styles, Northern or
          Southern style. Traditionally a mixture of stretching movements
          incorporated with massaging techniques using the hands and a special
          wooden stick are used to stimulate the activity of internal organs and
          improve the blood and lymph circulation.
          <br />
          <br />
          Thai foot massage is very different to Reflexology because it uses a
          special wooden stick with cream to focus on the feet and legs. Both
          massage and stretching techniques are used making this treatment very
          versatile. Hence, this treatment can be run as a treatment on its own
          or incorporated into other existing routines such as Reflexology.

          We offer several levels and versions of Thai Foot Massage, in order to
          prevent over saturation and allow students to expand their knowledge
          and learn techniques at a pace that suits. One to one means just that,
          we only ever have maximum two students in any one class! You will need
          to practice the technique 5 times before you gain your certificate.
          Why? Because sometimes after you complete a course you may have
          unanswered questions so post practice gives you a chance to get the
          techniques clear in your mind and have the security of knowing you
          have aftercare learning support.
          <br />
          <br />
          After completion of the course, students will have learnt how to
          complete a Thai Foot massage routine lasting for approximately 40
          minutes. The Northern style of Thai Foot Massage will be mainly
          focused on in Level 1. Further levels are available allowing
          successful students to expand their knowledge, learning new and more
          advanced techniques. In Level 2 the original Southern style techniques
          will be introduced and in level 3 techniques focusing on the neck and
          shoulders will be taught allowing students to combine everything they
          have learnt in previous levels to offer a top to bottom routine.
          <br />
          <br />
          Please wear clothing that is comfortable, flexible to move in and
          trousers that can easily be rolled up as we will work on both the feet
          and legs.

        <h4 className={styles.h4}>Why learn Thai foot massage?</h4>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          Thai foot massage uses both hands and a stick so there is less strain
          and pressure on your hands preventing repetitive strain syndrome. Thai
          foot massage is a popular treatment that is a little different from
          reflexology so it gives you an edge over the competition. You can get
          insurance allowing you to practice on the general public and charge
          for your treatment. Most importantly, you will learn on a one to one
          basis meaning you get direct feedback and have a chance to practice on
          the teacher. After all, massage is about how it feels and not about
          how it looks.

          Traditional Oil massage uses flowing massage movements alongside
          gentle stretching techniques making it very different from other
          massage therapies practiced today. Emphasis is put on re-balancing the
          energy within the body, strokes are long and rhythmic. This treatment
          is not only wonderfully relaxing but also beneficial in relieving
          aching muscles from the body without causing pain to the receiver.
          Clients often report to experience a feeling of floating and the
          therapist having "many hands".

        <p className={styles.text}>
          Reiki is a Japanese form of saying "Universal life force energy" and
          the belief behind it that practitioners channel the energy and pass it
          onto the receiver for healing purposes. It is a non invasive hands off
          treatment that is given by the therapist laying their hands over
          special energy centres around the client's body. Reiki is not taught
          but instead passed on by a series of "attunements" from level 1 to
          Masters which allows you to attune other people.

          Mongolian Sky Energy® was developed by Karen Bayley after taking
          training in Mongolia for a therapy called Chingus Massage. Mongolian
          Sky Energy® is an energetically based treatment that uses slow and
          soothing hands on massaging techniques to help re-balance energy
          centres within the body. Its ideology is based upon Mongolia's ancient
          understanding and connection to nature and the elements. It involves
          an initial attunement and then once the energies have been received,
          you will learn a series of flowing movements which focus on the back
          and chakras. Two days intensive course, plus one day for the practical
          exam, plus 15 full case studies.
